## Tri 3 TPT 0.1 related to Beneficial and Harmful Effects of Computing Big Idea 5.1
### [5.1 Notes Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kQbh1VdSiUpJkbDKV9SwbjAjB1ji_1PBo8F3Nbozk_o/edit)
### Action 1: Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing
#### Benefits:
- Computing can be used to make people's lives easier
- People can solve problems that wouldn't be able to be solved otherwise by using computing
- People can better communicate with each other through computing
#### Harmful Effects:
- It is easier for people to harm each other through social media
- Computing can create laziness, as computers are able to automate most things
- People who wish to do harm to others through hacking are able to do so easily

### Action 2: Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?
- The dopamine issue entailed in the TPT lesson depict how video games can cause brains to release dopamine, which lead to people wanting to keep playing them. Dopamine is typically released when your brain is expecting a reward, causing you to feel pleased. In addition to video games, activities that people associate with pleasure also trigger the release the dopamine, such as eating your favorite food, or meeting with your friends. Although video games are fine in moderation, the dopamine that is released cause people to continue to play them since humans naturally crave pleasure. This is what causes the "addictive" nature of video games. If someone is spending too much time online, then that means that they will spend less time taking care of their bodies and studying for school, which results in the problems that the student had in the TPT example. To combat this, people should also try to do other things that they like in real life, which will lessen the hold that being online has over one's pleasure.
