## Notes
### Intellectual Property
* Intellectual Property (IP): a work or invention that is result of creativity to which one has rights
### Copyright
* Copyright protects your IP and keeps anyone from using it, unless you give them permission
* Plagiarism: Presenting material as your own
* Legal ways to use material created by someone else:
  * Creative Commons

### Creative Commons
* Creative Commons provides free licenses that you can use to tell others how you want them to use your creations
  * It clearly tells others what they can and can not do with your IP
### Open Source and Open Access
* Open Source: programs made freely available for anyone to use and may be redistributed and modified
* Open Access: online research output free of any and all restrictions on access and free of many restrictions on use, such as copyright or license restrictions
### Legal and Ethical Concerns

## Actions
When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in GitHub pages.
- To license a public repository on Github so that it is open source, you must follow a few steps:
  - First, you should create a license file within your project
  - Then, you should choose what license to use. Github offers several licenses:
    - Academic Free License
    - Apache License
    - Creative Commons License family
    - And many more!

Make a license for your personal and Team project. Document license you picked and why.
- I am choosing the MIT license for my individual repository and our team project because it is the most reliable license and allows for most people to use it freely
