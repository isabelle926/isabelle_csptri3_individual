# Crowdsourcing
## Notes:
- Widespread access to information and public data facilitates the identification of problems, development of solutions, and dissemination of results
- Science has been affected by using distributed and "citizen science" to solve scientific problems
- Citizen science is a scientific research conducted in whole or part by distributed individuals, many of whom may not be scientists, who contribute relevant data to research using their own computing devices

## Actions: 
- CompSci has 150 principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?
  - A crowdsource idea that could work with this group is creating an interactive classroom in which students could contribute individual lines of code for a certain program. This could be initiated using collaborative platforms such as Google services. 
- What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your final project be better with crowdsourcing?
  - You could survey Del Norte students about their academic workload, mental health, etc. to gather more data for a final project. My final project could be better with crowdsourcing because we could take input from other students and integrate it into our website.
