# Beneficial and Harmful Effects
* As time progresses, people can create better computing innovations
* As a result, people often change the way they complete tasks to incorporate these new computing innovations, increasing efficiency and quality
* Although technological advancements and innovations are often made with potential benefits in mind, they often have unforeseen effects
* These effects can be viewed as both beneficial and harmful by different people, or even by the same person
* Thus, responsible programmers should consider the unintended ways their computing innovations can be used and the potential consequences of these new uses
* A programmer should also keep in mind that it is impossible to consider all the ways a computing innovation can be used
* These advancements have not only improved the computing field, but they have also generated and increased creativity in other fields, such as medicine, engineering, communications, and the arts.
