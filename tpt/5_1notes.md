# Beneficial and Harmful Effects
## Notes
* As time progresses, people can create better computing innovations
* As a result, people often change the way they complete tasks to incorporate these new computing innovations, increasing efficiency and quality
* Although technological advancements and innovations are often made with potential benefits in mind, they often have unforeseen effects
* These effects can be viewed as both beneficial and harmful by different people, or even by the same person
* Thus, responsible programmers should consider the unintended ways their computing innovations can be used and the potential consequences of these new uses
* A programmer should also keep in mind that it is impossible to consider all the ways a computing innovation can be used
* These advancements have not only improved the computing field, but they have also generated and increased creativity in other fields, such as medicine, engineering, communications, and the arts.

Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?
- The dopamine issue entailed in the TPT lesson depict how video games can cause brains to release dopamine, which lead to people wanting to keep playing them. Dopamine is typically released when your brain is expecting a reward, causing you to feel pleased. In addition to video games, activities that people associate with pleasure also trigger the release the dopamine, such as eating your favorite food, or meeting with your friends. Although video games are fine in moderation, the dopamine that is released cause people to continue to play them since humans naturally crave pleasure. This is what causes the "addictive" nature of video games. If someone is spending too much time online, then that means that they will spend less time taking care of their bodies and studying for school, which results in the problems that the student had in the TPT example. To combat this, people should also try to do other things that they like in real life, which will lessen the hold that being online has over one's pleasure.
