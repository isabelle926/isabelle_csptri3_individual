# Safe Computing
## Notes
### Personally Identifiable Information
* Personally Identifiable Information (PII): information specific to an individual
* Can be used by people to steal someone's identity, bank funds, or to impersonate someone in order to gain access to an organization
* Search engines maintain a history of what you search
* Your search history is used to suggest other websites you may like or for targeted marketing
  * Your location can even be collected
### Personally Identifiable Information: The Good and The Bad
* PII can be used to enhance a user's online experience
* PII can be exploited if privacy and other protections are ignored
  * Information placed online can be used in ways that were not intended and that may have a harmful impact
### Risks to Privacy
* The information placed online is difficult to delete!
* Information posted to social media can be used by others and combined with other sources to deduce private information about you
  * This information can then be used in ways that were not intended and may have a harmful impact
### Authentication
* Authentication measures protect devices and information from unauthorized access
* Authentication measures:
  * Strong passwords
  * Multi-factor authentication
### Strong Passwords
* Creating strong passwords:
  * 10 or more characters
  * must contain a symbol
  * must contain a number
  * must contain lowercase and uppercase letters
### Multi-Factor Authentication
* Types of authentication:
  * What you know
  * What you are
  * What you have
### Virus and Malware
* Virus: malicious programs that can copy themselves and gain access to systems that they are not supposed to be allowed in
* Malware: often intended to damage a computing system or take partial control over its operation
  * Can infiltrate a system by posing as legitimate programs or by attaching itself to legitimate programs, like an email attachment
* Virus scans can help to prevent malicious code from getting into and affecting your system
### Encryption and Decryption
* Once legitimate access to a system is gained, it is important to ensure data sent to and from the system remains uncompromised
* Encryption: the process of encoding data to prevent unauthorized access
* Decryption: the process of decoding data
* Two types of encryption:
  * Symmetric encryption
  * Asymmetric encryption
* Symmetric encryption: one key used to both encrypt and decrypt data
  * Example: Caesar Cipher
### Asymmetric Encryption
* Public Key Encryption: uses two keys
  * A public key for encrypting
  * A private key for decrypting
* A sender does not need the receiver's private key to encrypt a message
* The receiver's private key IS required to decrypt the message
### Digital Certificates
* Certificate authorities issue digital certificates that validate the ownership of encryption keys used in secure communications and are based on a trust model
### The Importance of the Internet
* The Internet is an integral part of our lives
### Risks to Personal Safety
* Phishing: An attempt to trick a user into providing personal information, like your usernames and passwords, account numbers, or social security numbers
* Phishing emails often look like they're from a company you know and trust:
  * your bank
  * your credit card company
  * social networking site
  * video streaming site
  * online store
* They trick you into clicking a link or opening an attachment
* Clicking a link or opening an attachment in a phishing email will cause unexpected harm:
  * virus installed on your computer
  * spoofed banking website
  * keylogger installed
* Keylogger: Records every keystroke made by a user in order to gain fraudulent access to passwords or other confidential information
* Rogue Access Point: A wireless network that can give unauthorized access to secure networks

## Actions
Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles.
- CRUD Project: name, email, password, phone

What are your feelings about PII and your exposure?
- PII should not be displayed if it contains sensitive information. For example, I would not want to have my password displayed for anyone to see.
- Good passwords:
  - (h3e$e8ur9er5 -- cheeseburgers
  - 1s@b3ll3!$Aw350m3 -- isabelle is awesome
- Bad passwords:
  - password
  - bob
  - 1234567890
- In addition to passwords, you can also authenticate your identity with your username, your driver license, and your face

Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption
- Symmetric encryption: method of encrypting a message so that only the sender and receiver can read it
- Asymmetric encryption: also known as public-key encryption, uses one public key and one private key to encrypt and decrypt a message and protect it from unauthorized access

Provide and example of encryption we used in deployment.
- SSL Encryption

Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques
- I am incredibly smart and wise, so I have never fallen for a phishing scheme.
- Some phishing techniques include the fake invoice scam, the email account upgrade scam, the paypal scam, and other things
