# Compuuting Bias
## Notes: 
- Computing innovations can reflect existing human biases b ecause of biases written into the algorithms or biases in the data used by the innovation
- Programmers should take action to reduce bias in algorithms used for computing innovations as a way of combating existing human biases\
- Biases can be embedded at all levels of software development

## Actions:
Come up with some thoughts on the video and be ready to discuss them as I call on you. Here are some ideas...
- Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional?
  - The owner of the computer does not think this was intentional
- If yes or no, justify you conclusion.
  - The owner of this computer seems simply confused as to why this is happening. 
- How do you think this happened?
  - This probably happened because the people who were making this algorithm trained the software using only images of white people
- Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude?
  - This is not harmful since it is only a face-tracking camera. It was probably not intended to exclude. 
- Should it be corrected?
  - Yes
- What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome?
  - Use data of people from all races when training the software.
